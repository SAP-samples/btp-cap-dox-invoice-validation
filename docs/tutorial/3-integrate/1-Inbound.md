## Inbound

As already mentioned in one of the former chapters - the invoices that need to be validated usually arrive attached as PDF file to emails or as postal letters which need to be scanned afterwards.

To **enhance the described scenario with own invoices** - different from the 3 provided sample invoices - the following steps are necessary:

1. Store the PDF invoice file via **BTP Object Store** Service - Bucket and Object-ID will be returned
2. Add the invoice meta data to following **SAP HANA Cloud** database tables: Table1, Table2, ...
3. What else???

After successful validation of the invoice, this scenario could be connected upstream of **SAP Central Invoice Management (CIM)** or **OpenText Vendor Invoice Management (VIM)** or any other comparable solution to complete the payment process afterwards.

To simulate the upstream you could download a PDF snapshot file (via the `Download Snapshot` button) of the validated invoice an transfer it to the dedicated file upload directory which could be accessed by **SAP Central Invoice Management (CIM)** or **OpenText Vendor Invoice Management (VIM)** or other comparable solutions.

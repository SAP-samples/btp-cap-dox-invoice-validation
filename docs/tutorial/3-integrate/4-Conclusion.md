## Conclusion

To conclude, you should now have a clear understanding of the invoice validation scenario that this sample covers. If you made it to the end of the mission, you
have deployed the sample, and any BTP services that it relies on, to your own subaccount on the BTP. You have set up the app locally for development to extend it, or to add your own invoices.

Hopefully, you see now, how the DOX service further facilitates the invoice validation, e.g., you can copy over position values from the invoice automatically to quickly start correcting the position.

Feel free to also revisit the [teaser video](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_cma51zr3) for this sample.
